    "\n",
    "* Do district lines dilute votes of minority voters (e.g. via cracking/packing)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where should additional 2 congressional districts be placed in Texas for fair representation of minorities?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Texas has experienced a 15.3% population growth from 2010-2019, resulting in an addition of 2 new CD being alloted to Texas. This growth has been largely driven by growing minority populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "VRA Section 2 prohibits redistricting plan that abridges any citizen's right to vote \"on account of race or color (or membership in a language-minority group).\" Minority groups can assess whether a map violates VRA by evaluating  whether members of the minority group have \"less opportuntity than other members of the electirate to nominate and elect representatives of their choice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical information from recent elections can be used in assessment BUT VRA does not require that protected class must be elected in numbers proportionate to electorate demographics. However, in states where party affiliation overlaps with racial group identities, Section 2 does require districts be designed to allow minority groups to elect their preferred candidate, not just the candidate preferred by the majority (usually White) within the party. Thus, VRA stipulates the right to replace districts where minority-preferred candidates lose with districts where candidates are given the opportunity to win if they \"pull, haul, and trade to find common ground\" (Johnson v De Grandy, 1994).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodological Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to identify the preferred candidate for each demographic group?\n",
    "\n",
    "VRA Preprint Method: _Statewide elections only (apples to apples comparison since candidates in one district is not an option in another district; how voting preferences would transfer is unclear)_\n",
    "\n",
    "Vote totals are not reported by raicail group -> ecological inference to determine which candidate is preferred by each demo group. \n",

    "__Part 1: Effectiveness Score Calc__\n",
    "\n",
    "VRA Preprint Method: consider districts to be 'effective' if they nominate (primary) and elect (generals) minority-preferred candidates (based on plurality/coalitions). Does not explicitly consider demographic targets a priori to avoid FP/FNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectiveness Scores: (election recency) * (clear candidate choice) * (group member preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) unweighted score: (1 * 1 * 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) weight based on statewide election patterns (clear candidate of choice - CI from statewide EI)\n",

    "recency weights: elections discounted by each year of age by a multiplicative factor of $2^\\frac{1}{4}$ {1: most recent, 0.841: 1 year, 0.707: 2 years, 0.595: 3 years, 0.5: 4 years, 0.421: 5 years}\n",
    "\n",
    "group member preferred: 1 - belongs to same group; 0.5 - belongs to other group (up-weight elections where minority candidate belongs to same group to ensure that minority group preferred candidates don't only win when white)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Part 2: Calibration of Scores__\n",
    "\n",
    "logit regression to calibrate raw scores -> accounts for 'group control factor' (demographic composition in district - higher CVAP entails more control in district, not just influence)\n",
    "\n",
    "normalize raw scores based on observed success data from actual enacted districts (congressional, state senate, state house elections from previous decade)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A district is considered effective if the calibrated score exceeds a certain threshold for the demographic group (e.g. s > 0.6)\n",

Regester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973)) set the basic standard for the maximum acceptable population deviation for state legislative districts: the combined deviation of the most populous district and the least populous district from the ideal district population may not exceed 10 percent, and all the other district populations must fall within that narrow range\n",

In congressional districts, each deviation from the ideal district size must be justified on the basis of a rational state policy or be found to be unavoidable despite a good faith effort to draw districts with equal population (Karcher v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725 (1983)). As a result, congressional districts are usually drawn to be almost exactly the same in population."
