# Developing Ensemble Methods for Initial Districting Plan Evaluation
This repository collects associated Python scripts and data to support the 2021 UW Data Science for Social Good project, "Developing Ensemble Methods for Initial Districting Plan Evaluation".

# Project Details

Broadly, this project has two core aims: to understand how computational tools can be used to assist in the drawing of maps and to evaluate the fairness of proposed plans. The data used in this project come from [MGGG Redistricting Lab](https://github.com/mggg-states). Details about original data source and the processing steps can be found on the state's associated repo. 

# Reproducibility

To reproduce case study results and to follow along with our stakeholder protocol, please ensure the following steps are taken first:

* Set REDISTRICTING_HOME environment variable to base location of project using `export REDISTRICTING_HOME=[your_path]`.
