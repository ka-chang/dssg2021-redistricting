https://redistricting.colorado.gov/content/redistricting-laws Congressional Language (Section 44.3):
“Thereafter, the commission shall, to the extent possible, maximize the number of politically competitive districts…
‘competitive’ means having a reasonable potential for the party affiliation of the district’s representative to change
at least once between federal decennial censuses. Competitiveness may be measured by factors such as a proposed district’s
past election results,
a proposed district’s political party registration data,
and evidence-based analyses of proposed districts.”
